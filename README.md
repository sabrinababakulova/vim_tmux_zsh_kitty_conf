# vim + tmux + zsh + kitty terminal setup

this is to store the information about my terminal in ever case i will need it

## how to run it all

in .zshrc you will find the links to folders to some of the items, gotta change them to the proper ones

the nvim folder should be placed in .config file and with packer (already installed) gotta run :so and :PackerSync

tmux should be placed in some weird place, i use: source $HOME/.tmux.conf but you can use the location of current file, wherever it is in the system

kitty conf can be placed wherever i suppose

i also use oh-my-posh to make terminal pretty, but i forgot about it while doing this repo, so just download and tweak it to your liking
